# Grocery Tracker Program
## Purpose
The Purpose of this program is to assist a grocery store with keeping track of the items purchased throughout the day. This program can read a source text file and then use the information from that file to return a list of all the items purchased, either with the number purchased or in the form of a histogram. The program can also return how many of a specific item were sold if the user enters the name of the product. This helps the grocery store more easily understand its inventory.
## Strengths
I think one of the strengths in this program is how it handles adding items to a vector to get the final count for each of the items.
## Improvements
This program could use a more robust way to validate user input. At the moment, it works by accepting integers to select which function it should do. Error handling could be added to the program to better handle if a user input something other than an integer.
## Challenges
The most challenging part of writing this program also in my opinion became its greatest strength. Initially, I struggled with checking the items that were already in the list and adding new items to the list if that item was not already in the list. I was eventually able to fix this issue by messing with different methods for adding elements to a vector.
## Transferable Skills
I think the work I did with learning how to create classes will be the most transferable. Being able to make objects by using a class is such a powerful tool that can be used in a ton of different contexts.
## Maintainability
I made this program maintainable by thoroughly commenting what each function and section of the functions were meant to do. This makes it so that others can more easily understand the intention and purpose of different sections of code.
